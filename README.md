# The future of scala.concurrent.Future
![logo.png](logo.png)
___
## 🧰 Why this library?

`Task[E, A]` is a lightweight monad built on top of `scala.concurrent.Future`, but with a type parameter for the 
error. The advantage of this is that if a function return a `Task[DomainException, Int]` it can only fail
with an error which is a subtype of `DomainException` (or a fatal exception). 

`Task` can also be used interchangeably with the `Future` monad and has the same performance. 
This means that you do not need to learn or introduce a new effect system to your codebase and your code 
can use the same libraries that you are already using with `Future`. Finally, this library is designed to be as
lightweight as possible, and has no dependencies.

### Similar Libraries
If you are already used to working with typed errors and instead want to go the extra mile to
change effect system I would recommend checking out [ZIO](https://zio.dev/overview/getting-started)
or [Monix BIO](https://bio.monix.io/docs/introduction).

## ⚙️ Getting Started
### Installation
Setup via `build.sbt`:

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "io.github.ragazoor" %% "task" % "0.1.17"
```

### Examples

- Basic usage [link](examples/src/main/scala/io/github/ragazoor/task/examples/basic/BasicMain.scala):
  - Code with error types 
  - Conversion from `Future` to `Task`
  - Mapping errors `Throwable` to custom error type
- Interoperability with `scala.concurrent.Future` libraries [link](examples/src/main/scala/io/github/ragazoor/task/examples/interop/InteropMain.scala):
- Migrating from `scala.concurrent.Future` to `Task` [link](examples/src/main/scala/io/github/ragazoor/task/examples/migration/MigrationExample.scala):

## 📋 Migration

The goal of this library is to be as lightweight as possible, with this in mind I am reusing as much as possible
from `scala.concurrent.*`. This makes migration easy as well, it is mostly about replacing 
`scala.concurrent.Future` with `io.github.ragazoor.task.*` and `io.github.ragazoor.task.implicits.*`.

You have to fix the code manually mainly in the following ways:

- If we are using a third-party library returning a `scala.concurrent.Future`
  we need to convert it to `Task` using `.toTask` and the implicit class in
  `io.github.ragazoor.task.implicits.FutureToTask`.
- If we are using implicit classes which act on `scala.concurrent.Future`, fix the 
  implicit class or convert task to `Future` using `.toFuture`
- If you have interfaces in your code like `A => StdFuture[B]`, which are hard to change,
  there are implicits in `import io.github.ragazoor.task.migration.implicits._` to help.
- If you are using implicit classes that extends `scala.concurrent.Future`
  the compiler will not be able to convert
  like one might think using the migration implicits. So we need to make
  it explicit:
